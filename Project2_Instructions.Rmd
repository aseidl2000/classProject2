# QuickStart Data Science Bootcamp<br>Cohorts 3 and 4 - Jonathan Fowler

## Project 2 (R)
```
For this project, think of yourself as a developer on a corporate business intelligence team. You have been given a flat file (CSV format) of login information from Maximo, an asset tracking system the company relies on. Current licensing requires that no more than 95 users in the AUTHORIZED and/or LIMITED groups be online at any given time. The deliverables outlined in this project will be submitted to the IT director, who wants to be sure that the licensing threshold is not exceeded.

### The Data

The data is included in this project. The filename is **Project2Data.csv**.

| Field     | Description   |
|-----------|--------------|
| attemptdate        | Date and Time of event          |
| attemptresult | LOGIN, LOGOUT, TIMEOUT, or SYSLOGOUT |
| userid  | The user triggering the event |
| type      | User type, i.e., AUTHORIZED |
| maxsessionuid   | Unique identifer for a session. This will show up from LOGIN to LOGOUT, TIMEOUT, or SYSLOGOUT. |
```

### Part 1

# Let's answer some basic questions about the dataset. You may insert your code below each of these lines.  

#**Prework: Load the CSV file into your environment.**  
```{r}
Proj2Data <- read.csv("Project2Data.csv")
summary(Proj2Data) # Data loads successfully
```

#**1. How many unique users? A simple number will do here, no tables or formatting needed.**  
```{r}
NumUsers <- length(unique(Proj2Data$userid))
# The number of users is 763
```

#**2. How many unique levels, unique users in each? I want a table that shows this information together.**  

# One aspect of constructing UserType this way is that it only eliminates unique rows, not unique users
# That way, if some users' type changes over the time period, they will get counted multiple times
# Maybe such information would be helpful some day
# But for now, if we only want unique users and  can forget about their type, we have to check for duplicate users after eliminating duplicate rows

UserType <- data.frame("userid" = Proj2Data$userid, "type" = Proj2Data$type)
UserType <- unique(UserType) 
# shows users in column 1 and their type in column 2
nrow(UserType) 
# shows 763 rows, meaning no users were duplicated, and all users only had 1 type during March
nrow(UserType) == NumUsers 
# Checks if any users had more than 1 type in March.  They did not, so the answer is "TRUE"
table(UserType$type)  
# shows a table of the number of users in each type
# shows 196 Express, 141 Authorized, and 426 Limited users



#**3. What is the average session time for each unique group?**  

# Question number 4 was eliminated, but there was still a need to remove duplicates to get a good answer
# to number 3.  There were several kinds of duplicates which were removed in different ways.

SessionData <- Proj2Data[order(Proj2Data$maxsessionuid),] #Order everything by maxsessionuid to visualize
# Observe about 1400 rows where maxsessionuid = 0.  These are likely to cause problems and will be eliminated
SessionData <- na.omit(SessionData[SessionData$maxsessionuid != 0,]) 
# gets rid of NA and 0, around 1000 of 57000 rows, no big deal
SessionStart <- SessionData[SessionData$attemptresult == "LOGIN",] 
# selects only the logins
SessionEnd <- SessionData[SessionData$attemptresult != "LOGIN",] 
# selects only logouts
SessionStartEnd <- merge(SessionStart, SessionEnd, by = "maxsessionuid") 
# Merges every maxsessionuid so it has a login and logout in the same row.
# Only sessions with a login are counted.  The first few sessions with an unknown login are orphaned
# SessionStartEnd[SessionStartEnd$attemptresult.y == "RESTART",] 
# shows 18 restarts, which count as a logout, and were left in.
nrow(SessionStartEnd)
# shows 28819 rows
table(SessionStartEnd$userid.x == SessionStartEnd$userid.y)
# shows userid.x and .y are always the same
table(SessionStartEnd$type.x == SessionStartEnd$type.y)
# shows type.x and .y are always the same
SessionStartEnd <- SessionStartEnd[,-match(c("userid.y","type.y"),names(SessionStartEnd))] 
# gets rid of redundant userid.y and type.y data columns because we have shown they are always redundant
SessionStartEnd$difftime <- difftime(SessionStartEnd$attemptdate.y, SessionStartEnd$attemptdate.x, unit="mins")
# shows each session time in minutes
length(SessionStartEnd$difftime[SessionStartEnd$difftime == 0])
# shows 1563 sessions where length = 0 minutes, or about 5% of all sessions. I would delete them, but I heard we are instructed to leave them in.  I left them in for this problem, #3.
table(SessionStartEnd$attemptresult.y) # 2399 syslogouts
# There are 2399 syslogouts which are usually, but not always, after another logout.  We will have to keep them for now

# SessionStartEnd <- SessionStartEnd[SessionStartEnd$attemptresult.y != "SYSLOGOUT",]
# table(SessionStartEnd$attemptresult.y) # 0 syslogouts
# Now the only logouts are logouts, timeouts, and a tiny handful of restarts.
# nrow(SessionStartEnd)
# Rows have been reduced to 26420.  But more duplicates still need to be removed. Some sessionids are duplicated, for example 876350
table(duplicated(SessionStartEnd$maxsessionuid)) 
# shows 35 duplicates and 26385 nonduplicates if syslogouts are eliminated
# shows 2361 duplicates if syslogouts are included


# SessionByDate <- SessionStartEnd[order(SessionStartEnd$attemptdate.x,SessionStartEnd$attemptdate.y),] 

# orders everything first by logout date, then orders everything by login date.  All sessionids will be grouped.  For all duplicate sessions, the longest session will be the last one.  We had some discussion about how to count the duplicates.  To delete more rows will reduce the number of current users at any given time and make our company more likely to stay below the 95 user threshold, but there could be an ethical problem to this.  We unfortunately don't know and can't know what kinds of sessions should count for sure, but Maximo has an incentive to inflate this number and our company has an incentive to decrease it. I f a user logged in to 2 different sessionids at the exact same second, I will treat that as 1 session, ending at the first logout given.  If they logged in to different sessionids at different moments in time, though the sessions themselves overlap, I would conclude that multiple people may be using the same user account, and it could be viewed as dishonest if we combined them into only one session, so I will leave those as separate.

# for example, the following sessionids will be treated as 1 session:
#131	875215	2020-03-01 16:23:09	LOGIN	HBA2023	AUTHORIZED	2020-03-01 16:53:46	TIMEOUT	30.61666

# These sessions, however, will be counted separately:
#36	874304	2020-03-01 06:25:22	LOGIN	HBA1654	LIMITED	2020-03-01 06:58:09	TIMEOUT	32.783

#What if a user logs in at one moment, then manages to login a second time a minute later, and has a 30 minute session.  The code I have written would not catch that.  But we'll catch it later.  We've done enough for now.

1) Question 4 is no longer part of this project. Please ignore.
2) There is a scratch script in the updated Project 2 RStudio Cloud file that can help you work towards the remaining questions.
3) You are encouraged to work together as a development team. You will still be submitting individual work, but I encourage you to work together to solve issues and learn how to collaborate as a dev team.
4) In addition to your code, I’d like to see a brief paragraph on your experience from start to finish on the project. How did it feel to get the specs and realize that you needed more information/clarification, working together as a team, and being able to push back some on the client (me) in order to set expectations?
5) Please feel free to join all QA sessions this week regardless of which one you are in. Also, Gina Choe is the point person for the student work sessions outside of QA time. (Thank you Gina for organizing!)

I know this assignment is not as easy as it may have looked in the beginning, and I understand the feelings you’ve shared. Trust me, I’ve been where you are. The good news is that you all are taking it in stride and responding with excellent questions, clarification, and level-setting. I am so happy for your progress.

### Part 2
```
Your objective in this part is to create a Gantt chart that shows the following:  
1. One unique userid per row <br>
2. A Gantt chart on the right <br>
3. Blocks of time representing when each user logged in, mapped on the time field <br>
4. User's time blocks colored by which group they belong to <br>

max(Mar2020$CurUsers2)

#123 with no filtering, 106 after filtering out duplicates, 104 after filtering out EXPRESS logins, still 98 after filtering out 0-minute sessions.  Started over with SessionByUser5, and the result was 113 max.  Started over again, fixing some of the duplicate removal, and the new max was 97.  After building the new function below, and redoing the whole thing, the new max was 83.  Drawing SessionByUser5 from SessionByUser2 instead of SessionByUser3, the number rises to 93

# This shows 1 case of duplicate where the logins for HBA1849 were only 1 second apart, and the 2 sessions lasted 30-35 minutes
# There is also 1 case of HBA2346, who was logged in twice at the same time.  This was not filtered out by the earlier DupFinder because his login happened to be at the exact same time as HBA1849, and was not caught.  It was one of those funny triplicate cases.  Now, let's get rid of all these duplicates

-----------------------------

You're dealing with a lot of data, so a single chart that shows all users for the whole month would be impossible to read. How are you going to break this out into multiple, manageable charts? It's okay to produce a chart for each week in the month. Just show the code that creates all the charts.

```
# insert your code that produces the correct result here; this should include your data wrangling and ggplot2 construction
```

### Submissions

Because we all will be working with the same data, you will only need to send me an updated version of this Markdown file. Please save it as *lastname_firstinitial_Project2.Rmd* and email to me directly at [jon@fowlercs.com](mailto:jon@fowlercs.com). Submissions must be made by **May 19 2020 11:59PM ET**.

#### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
